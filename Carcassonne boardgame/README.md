# Carcassonne
Carcassonne is a tile-based German-style board game for two to five players, designed by Klaus-Jürgen Wrede and published in 2000 by Hans im Glück in German and by Rio Grande Games (until 2012) and Z-Man Games (currently)[1] in English.[2] It received the Spiel des Jahres and the Deutscher Spiele Preis awards in 2001. It is named after the medieval fortified town of Carcassonne in southern France, famed for its city walls. The game has spawned many expansions and spin-offs, and several PC, console and mobile versions.

How to use it

We recommend to use maximum power and change the speed acording to the desired color, because there are a lot of area to record and the more speed, the less it late. In case you want to make a cut or raster more clear that the 100 speed and 100 power, try to reduce power and maintain maximum speed. The configurations used to cut with our cutting are:

Ground: Raster Engraving power = 100, speed = 50 and frequency = 1000.

Roofs: Raster Engraving power = 50, 100 speed frequency 1000.

Bushes: Raster Engraving power = 10, speed = 100 and frequency = 1000.

Castles: Raster Engraving power = 17, speed = 100 and frequency = 1000.

Patterns: Vector Engraving power = 100, speed = 100, frequency 1000.

Margins: Vector Cut 10 = power, speed = 100 and frequency = 1000.


The process to cut the pieces and test it to find the correct values:

1. Sticks the material close to the machine because it made many prints and it has to be synchronized and must fit. Also depending on the machine it could be late long time.
2. After that, set the z as usual.
3- Then hide all layers except layer roofs and vector drawing lines. Opens the configuration of the machine and entered the corresponding values. Finally pulled the file.
4-The next step is the same as above but with the layer ground with the values of speed and power for this raster.
5- Once we have the ground, the lines and the roofs recorded, we repeat the same process with the layer castle and their values to raster it.
6-Finally repeat the same process with the other two layers, the bushes are rasterized and margin cuted.
7- You can remove the pieces.
